# ABSTRACT

Gentoo Linux fork that works Out Of The Box (OOTB) without sacrificing end-users performance and optimization for multiple configurations including Desktop Environments (DE) and Window Managers (WM) presets.

Optionally binhosts provided by Argent GNU/Linux will/are also available in our fork, but are optional untill Argent GNU/Linux Developer team is able to make them to not sacrifice the optimization and performance.

Our goal is to make gentoo fork with additional features that works on all devices at the best possible performance and optimization.
